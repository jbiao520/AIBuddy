## Local LLM Setup

This extension requires a local LLM server running on port 3000. The server should expose two endpoints:

Make sure your local LLM server is running before using the extension.

3. Wait for the AI analysis to appear in a popup
4. Click the Ã— to close the popup when done

## Development

The extension consists of the following files:

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `content.js` - Handles text selection and popup display
- `popup.html/js` - Extension popup interface
- `background.js` - Background processes
- `styles.css` - Styling for the UI elements
